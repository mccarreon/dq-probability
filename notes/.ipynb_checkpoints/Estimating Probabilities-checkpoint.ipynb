    "# Estimating Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "A **random experiment** is an experiment where we can't predict outcomes with certainty. For example, tossing a coin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we can't predict the outcome for sure, we can estimate probabilities associated with outcomes. A coin toss has two possible outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the probability of a coin landing on heads we can: \n",
    "* Toss the coin many times (repeating the random experiment)\n",
    "* Count the number of times the coin landed on heads\n",
    "* Divide that number by thet otal number of times we tossed the coins\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, this would give us the probability of a coin landing heads up. Let's say we got these results:\n",
    "* Heads: 56\n",
    "* Tails: 44\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the probability of flipping heads as P(H) = 0.56. Calculating probability of an event by performing an experiment one or more times is called **experimental** or **empirical** probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Examples:\n",
    "* Dice rolled: 200 times\n",
    "* Number of times 6 occurred: 28\n",
    "* Number of times an odd number occurred: 102"
