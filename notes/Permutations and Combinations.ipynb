    "# Permutations and Combinations \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've learned to calculate probabilities for different events. Now, we will focus on calculating the number of outcomes associated with various random experiments. We'll learn how to answer questions like: \n",
    "* What is the probability of cracking a 4-digit PIN code using the code 8362?\n",
    "* What is the probability of cracking a 6-digit PIN code using the code 348821?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize in a state lottery if we use the numbers (3, 20, 37, 44, 45, 49)?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rule of Product\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a composite experiment *A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>* made of two different experiments, *A<sub>1</sub>* and *A<sub>2</sub>*. \n",
    "* *A<sub>1</sub>*: flipping a coin\n",
    "* *A<sub>2</sub>*: throwing a six-sided die\n",
    "\n",
    "*A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>* means we flip a coin and throw a die and consider the outcomes of the two individual experiments together. One out come of *A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>* is (H,1) meaning the coin flipped heads and the die rolled a 1. The sample space for *A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>* is:\n",
    "* $\\Omega$ = {(H,1),(H,2),(H,3),(H,4),(H,5),(H,6),(T,1),(T,2),(T,3),(T,4),(T,5),(T,6)}\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be represented using a **tree diagram** <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/380/pr1m4_tree_diagram_1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A coin flip has two possbile outcomes, and each outcome can be followed by six other ones from the die. If there are two outcomes and both are followed by six more, we can use multiplication for the total number: \n",
    "* Number of outcomes = 2 * 6 = 12\n",
    "The rule above is the **rule of product** (or multiplication principle). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Extended Rule of Product\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand the Rule of Product for any number of experiments. If we had a composite experiment *E<sub>1</sub>E<sub>2</sub>E<sub>3</sub>* where:\n",
    "* *E<sub>1</sub>* is flipping a coin\n",
    "* *E<sub>2</sub>* is rolling a six-sided die\n",
    "* *E<sub>3</sub>* is flipping a coin again\n",
    "\n",
    "The new tree diagram would look like this: \n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/380/pr1m4_tree_diagram_2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And the number of outcomes:\n",
    "* Number of outcomes = 2 * 6 * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep doing this for more experiments and its corresponding number of outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the probability of cracking a 4-digit PIN code using the code 8362?\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the new ways to find the total outcomes, we can revisit one of our original questions. We can use the formula:\n",
    "* P(E) = # of successful outcomes / total possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "And since there's only one code: \n",
    "* P(E) = 1 / total possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a code combination does not have replacement, the numbers are repeatable and each event has the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Since we have a four digit code, we can find the number of possible codes: \n",
    "* Number of codes = 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 10,000 \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of guessing a 4-pin code is: \n",
    "* 1/10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the probability of cracking a 6-digit PIN code using the code 348821?\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be done for finding the 6-pin code: \n",
    "\n",
    "* 1/10<sup>6</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "An arrangement where the order of the individual elements matters is a **permutation**. This is like our 4-digit pin code since it matters which number we enter first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forming permutations by sampling *without* replacement changes how we find the total number of outcomes. If we had the set {5,6,7} and wanted to form permutations without replacement: \n",
    "* Picked a 5\n",
    "* Set now contains {6,7}\n",
    "* Picked 7\n",
    "* Set now contains {6}\n",
    "* Picked 6\n",
    "* Permutation: 576\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we must use our extended rule of product like this: \n",
    "* Number of outcomes = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree would look like this: \n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/380/pr1m4_tree_diagram_3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize finding permutations: \n",
    "* Permutations = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be abbreviated as a **factorial**: \n",
    "* n! = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "For our example set {5,6,7}, n=3 we would get 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if we need the permutation for a limited number of cards? For example, in poker we have 5 cards in a hand. The number of permutations for a 5 card deck would be: \n",
    "* 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48 = 311,875,200\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can't just use n! to calculate this because it stops at the fifth card. To represent a permutation like this one we use this notation:\n",
    "* <i><sub>n</sub>P<sub>k</sub></i> = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * (n-k+1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where *n* = 52 and *k* = 5 for poker. *n* represents the total number of objects, *k* is the amount we're taking out. \n",
    "\n",
    "To write it neater, we can rewrite it like this: \n",
    "* <sub>n</sub>P<sub>k</sub> = n! / (n-k)!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the example above would be: \n",
    "* <sub>52</sub>P<sub>5</sub> = 52! / (52-5)! = 52!/47!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unique Arrangements\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the order of poker cards don't matter, we can consider each hand the same if they contain the same cards. This means it does not matter what order they appear in. What if we wanted to ignore the order and find the number of unique card arrangements? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the 5 cards. Each unique 5-card arrangement has 5! = 120 permutations. So, with the same 5 cards you can arrange them 120 different ways. If each hand can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways and there are *C* total unique hands, then C * 5! is the total number of permutations of a 5-card hand. \n",
    "* C * 5! = <sub>52</sub>P<sub>5</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to find the number of unique 5-card hands we solve for C giving us:\n",
    "* C = <sub>52</sub>P<sub>5</sub> / 5!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "If the order of elements in an arrangement don't matter, the arrangement is a **combination**. The formula for combinations is: \n",
    "* C = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n"
