    "* Outcomes\n",
    "* Events\n",

    "A random experiment is any process for which we can't predict outcomes with certainty. An outcome is a possible result of a random experiment. Events can have multiple outcomes and are always assigned a probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outcomes of a random experiment are usually represented as a **set**. A dice roll would look like this: \n",
    "* Outcomes = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a collection of *distinct* objects, so each outcome must occur only once. \n",
    "* {Heads, Heads} is not valid\n",
    "* {Heads, Tails} is valid\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all possible outcomes is called a **sample space**. It is often denoted by the $\\Omega$ symbol. The sample space of a die roll: \n",
    "* $\\Omega$ = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "If an event is impossible and has no probability of happening, we call it an **empty set** and denote it with $\\emptyset$. The probability of a certain event is 1 since it will always happen. Every other event ranges from 0 to 1. Example:\n",
    "* P(not heads or tails) = $\\emptyset$\n",
    "* P(heads) = 0.5\n",
    "* P(heads or tails) =  1\n",
