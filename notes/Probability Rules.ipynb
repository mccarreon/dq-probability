    "# Probability Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we learned about:\n",
    "* Random experiments\n",
    "* Outcomes\n",
    "* Events\n",
    "\n",
    "A random experiment is any process for which we can't predict outcomes with certainty. An outcome is a possible result of a random experiment. Events can have multiple outcomes and are always assigned a probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outcomes of a random experiment are usually represented as a **set**. A dice roll would look like this: \n",
    "* Outcomes = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a collection of *distinct* objects, so each outcome must occur only once. \n",
    "* {Heads, Heads} is not valid\n",
    "* {Heads, Tails} is valid\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all possible outcomes is called a **sample space**. It is often denoted by the $\\Omega$ symbol. The sample space of a die roll: \n",
    "* $\\Omega$ = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "If an event is impossible and has no probability of happening, we call it an **empty set** and denote it with $\\emptyset$. The probability of a certain event is 1 since it will always happen. Every other event ranges from 0 to 1. Example:\n",
    "* P(not heads or tails) = $\\emptyset$\n",
    "* P(heads) = 0.5\n",
    "* P(heads or tails) =  1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addition Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate P(A or B), this formula can be used:\n",
    "* P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for rolling a fair die (\"fair\" meaning each outcome has the same chance of occurring) the probability of getting a 3 **or** a 5 would be: \n",
    "* P(3) = 1/6\n",
    "* P(5) = 1/6\n",
    "* P(3 or 5) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule can be extended to more than two events. However, you *cannot* use the addition rule for events that share corresponding outcomes. For example: \n",
    "* Event C = {2,4,5}\n",
    "* Event D = {4,5,6}\n",
    "* Event C or D = {2,4,5,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "So calculating P(C or D) only works with the theoretical probability formula, which is the # of successful outcomes / # of possible outcomes. Otherwise, we'd get 6/6 which obviously isn't correct. \n",
    "* P(C or D) = 4/6\n",
    "\n",
    "Having both event C and event D happen would be like this: \n",
    "* P(C and D) = 2/6\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the set P(C and D) = {4,5} because those are the only overlapping outcomes for both. We can get the formula for P(C or D) like so: \n",
    "* P(C or D) = P(C) + P(D) - P(C and D)\n",
    "* P(C or D) = 3/6 + 3/6 - 2/6\n",
    "* P(C or D) = 4/6\n",
    "\n",
    "Events that don't intersect at all are **mutually exclusive** and cannot happen at the same time. If one event happens, the other one *cannot* happen. For example:\n",
    "* Getting a 5 (event one) and getting a 3 (event two) when we roll a regular six-sided die. You cannot get both a 5 and a 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Events that intersect are **mutually non-exclusive** and do have events that can occur simultaneously. For example: \n",
    "* Getting a number greater than 2 (event one) and getting an odd number (event two) when rolling a six-sided die. You can roll a 5, which is both greater than 2 and odd. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formula for mutually non-exclusive events: \n",
    "* P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n",
    "\n",
    "For mutually exclusive events the same formula applies, but P(A and B) is impossible and is equal to zero. \n",
    "* P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describing sets around \"and\" and \"or\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sets: \n",
    "* A = {1,2,6}\n",
    "* B = {1,4,5,6}\n",
    "* C = {HH, HT, TH}\n",
    "* D = {Green, Yellow, Brown}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unions\n",
    "When we say \"set A **or** set B,\" we are referring to a single set that is the result of the **union** between set A and set B. The resulting set has: \n",
    "* Elements of set A not in set B\n",
    "* Elements of set B not in set A\n",
    "* Elements in both A and B\n",
    "\n",
    "A set can only contain unique elements, so it does not include elements more than once. We use the $\\cup$ to denote unions. \n",
    "* A $\\cup$ B = {1,2,4,5,6}\n",
    "* A $\\cup$ D = {1,2,6, Green, Yellow, Brown}\n",
    "* B $\\cup$ C = {1,4,5,6,HH,HT,TH}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intersections\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say set A **and** set B, we refer to a single set that contains all unique elements that are in both A **and** B. The *and* operation is an **intersection** and denoted by $\\cap$. For example:\n",
    "* A $\\cap$ B = {1,6}\n",
    "* A $\\cap$ D = $\\emptyset$\n",
    "* B $\\cap$ C = $\\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this in describing probabilities so P(A or B) is P(A $\\cup$ B) and P(A and B) is P(A $\\cap$ B)."
